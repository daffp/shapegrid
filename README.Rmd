# shapegrid

Creates a grid of points within an ellipse. Code taken from https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/cpp_src/ellipse_grid/ellipse_grid.html.

Install package dependencies:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pkgs = c("Rcpp", "remotes" )
install.packages(pkgs)
```

Then install `shapegrid` package from github:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("daffp/shapegrid")
```

Run some examples to see that it is working

```{r}
library(shapegrid)
p = shapegrid::ellipse_grid(10, c(1,10), c(1,5))
plot(p, pch=16, cex=0.5)
```
